## The Surprising truth about your Brain: How to be at your best more often

### Dr. Jon Finn [@TougherMinds](https://twitter.com/TougherMinds)

> Technology is changing at lightning speed and it can often feel like you’re just not keeping up. This can lead to feelings of personal doubt (e.g. imposter syndrome) and mental fatigue. The suspiring truth is that these feelings of doubt are a natural response to 21st century life. This is because your brain is designed to survive and not flourish. This session will show how your brain is designed to work, why we sometimes doubt ourselves and beat ourselves up, and how we all can begin to build resilience.

> This session will cover:

> 1.  The dominant survival brain – the limbic regions
> 2.  Why dwelling on unhelpful thoughts can become an unhelpful habit
> 3.  The important role of the pre-frontal cortex in being resilient

Dr. Jon Finn is the founder and Managing Director of Tougher Minds. He is passionate about making complex science simple, so that people can use these insights to be their best and help others to be at their best.

Much of his current work is helping individuals, teams and managers in the City of London, and the USA, to harness individual and team success in the challenging modern work and societal context. This work includes supporting developers working for banks, investment managers and high-growth start ups to be at their best.

Jon has been working in the field of performance psychology and behaviour change for over 17 years. He completed his PhD at Leeds Beckett University investigating the role of emotional regulation in the challenging transitions of some of Britain’s most high-performing athletes. He has worked extensively in elite sport, particularly in professional football, rugby union, rugby league, cricket and golf.
