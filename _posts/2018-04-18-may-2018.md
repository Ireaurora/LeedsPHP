# The Talks

## Symfony 4 (Flex included)

### Jakub Zalas [@jakub_zalas](https://twitter.com/jakub_zalas)

> Symfony 4 is a result of evolution of the popular framework. While it's not a revolution, there's lots of things included that make our life much easier and more fun! Symfony was moved closer to industry practices with application bundles gone, simplified directory structure, or environment variables preferred over configuration parameters.

> Both versions 2 and 3 has already introduced some nice features, like autowiring, that contributed to what Symfony 4 has become. As a result there is less Symfony specific concepts and more standard practices. It's easier to learn, easier to configure, easier to install and deploy, and finally easier to master.

> If that wasn't enough, our workflow was much improved with the introduction of Symfony Flex, a new way to install and manage Symfony applications. It's time to say goodbye to both Symfony installer and the Standard Edition!

Jakub Zalas is an independent software consultant, architect and trainer, who helps teams to deliver software that survives change. Being focused on quality, Jakub promotes agile development practices like test driven development. In his spare time, he speaks at conferences and contributes to open source.

## Super Marek’s Testing Strategy
