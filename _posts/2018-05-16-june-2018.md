# The Talks

## Keeping it Real(time)
### Mike Lehan [@m1ke](https://twitter.com/m1ke)

> Modern web app interfaces can be dynamic with lots of data changing and flowing, but behind this there's often still a mass of AJAX requests & timers, making our work pseudo-live at best.
> Web sockets allow us to create two way live data flow between server & client; WebRTC lets us allow our clients to connect to one another directly. We'll see how PHP fits into this front end ecosystem and how to augment our applications with real time components.

## From bare metal boxes to Amazon ECS, our journey to the cloud
### Mark Taylor

> My talk will tell the story of how DealTrak moved from over a decade of bare metal hosting to AWS with practically zero downtime, and the technologies we opted for. We now use Docker consistently across all our environments, and manage our infrastructure - including deployments and spinning up UAT instances via Ansible playbooks.
