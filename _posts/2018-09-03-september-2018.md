# The Talks

## Object re-orientation

### Chris Riley - [@giveupalready](https://twitter.com/giveupalready)

> We are all SOLID developers who like to keep DRY, these are rules we stick to to try keep our code clean. Despite this, we often end up writing procedural code wrapped up inside objects. This code can be hard for our colleagues and collaborators to get to grips with and understand.
> Join me for this object reorientation as we take a look at how we can leverage the power of object oriented design to write code which is not just SOLID, but easy to reason about and easy for others to understand.

## Standardising ResellerClub’s API

### Robert Rosebury [@rerosebury](https://twitter.com/rerosebury)

> In this talk we’ll explore the difficulties and drawbacks we encountered using a third party domain reselling API. Issues that lead us to create an open source library to standardise it.
