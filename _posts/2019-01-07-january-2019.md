# The Talks

## Our Path to PHP 7 From 5.6

### Mark Taylor [@willCodeForAle](https://twitter.com/willCodeForAle)

> As you may be aware PHP 5.6 has now come to its end of life meaning no more security updates, and we at Dealtrak have been working on a large upgrade project in the last quarter of 2018. My talk will be a tale about the path we have taken when upgrading our core application from PHP 5.6 to PHP 7.2. I will go through the strategy we took, the testing tools we used, and explain the various bumps we encountered along the way - including one sizeable yet short term compromise!

## Working in a Collaborative Way Between SEO and Development

### Philip Broadhead [@_Phil83](https://twitter.com/_Phil83)

> Philip will be talking to us about the ways developers and SEO teams can better work together.
