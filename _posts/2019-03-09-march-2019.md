# The Talks

## Coding Standards That Actually Prevent Defects

### Stuart Herbert [@stuherbert](https://twitter.com/stuherbert)

> You've sat down to do a code review for a pull/merge request. How do you decide whether or not to accept the request? How do you agree amongst yourselves on that? And how to do train others to achieve a consistent level of quality for when they're doing code reviews too?

> In this talk, Stuart will show you a breakdown of PSR-2 - the PHP Community's main official coding standard - and look at the parts of PSR-2 that directly affect code quality. From there, he'll present a definition of what quality means, and how to go about writing your own in-house coding standards to achieve consistent quality across all your pull/merge requests.

## The AWeSomeness of Fargate

### Mark Taylor [@willCodeForAle](https://twitter.com/willCodeForAle)

> Fargate is a new(ish) compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to very easily run Docker containers for your PHP applications without having to manage any underlying virtual machines. I will go into how to run a simple PHP application with Fargate, and give you the low down of Fargate vs the EC2 launch type. We actually use a mix of both launch types at DealTrak, and I'll explain why we do that.
