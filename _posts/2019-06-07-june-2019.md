# The Talks

## Tests Make Good Architects

### Sam Burns [@SamBurnsUK](https://www.twitter.com/SamBurnsUK)

> This talk takes a look at the positive impacts that automated tests can have on architecture. Unit testing in PHPUnit or PhpSpec, as well as behavioural testing using tools like Behat, have a noticeable effect on software architecture. Tested (or testable) code is often easier to work with, cleaner, and has architectural advantages. We will take a look at some of the impacts that a good test suite can have on your application’s architecture, and how to let your tests be your architect.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls as a Junior Developer

### Jason Bruce-Halliwell [@JasonBruce88](https://www.twitter.com/JasonBruce88)

> Starting as a Junior Developer can be both exciting and overwhelming. Hopefully we can help you avoid common pitfalls and help you be a more confident developer, sooner rather than later.
