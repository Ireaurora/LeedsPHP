# The Talks

## Intro to BDD

### Ciaran McNulty [@CiaranMcNulty](https://www.twitter.com/CiaranMcNulty)

> Behaviour Driven Development techniques help us to ensure that the code we're writing is solving real-world problems. We will see how a BDD process can help us define a feature, write the code, and then validate the code using tools like Behat.

## Effective (remote) Working

### Hugh Noble [@HughNoble](https://www.twitter.com/HughNoble)

> Most of us will be working from home at the moment and I thought it would be a good idea to share some techniques that can implement to help us to work effectively as a team remotely.
