# The Talks

## Comparing Database Types

### Mark Taylor [@willCodeForAle](https://www.twitter.com/willCodeForAle)
> Often Developers will go with a commonly used relational database as it's what they're already comfortable with, however a relational database can often not be the best tool for the job. Learn instead how to choose the best database type for your project's requirements. Candidates for discussion will be Relational, NoSQL, Graph and Time Series databases.

## PHP and HTTP: Guzzle and SDKs

### Lorna Mitchel [@lornajane](https://www.twitter.com/lornajane)
> Does your application play nicely with others over HTTP? Bring your laptop and get ready to try out some API calls yourself as well as learn more about making calls from PHP. We'll be looking at GuzzleHTTP, an excellent HTTP client for PHP, as well as the HTTP features available in your favourite framework. Some APIs also make SDKs available, allowing you to bring in a dependency and make API calls very easily from your code. We'll look at a few options and when you might choose to adopt an SDK into your project. We can't be in one physical place right now but we can still write code together, so bring your laptop and your questions, and let's see what we can do!
