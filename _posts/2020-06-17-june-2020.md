# The Talks

## Understanding Git

### Zvonimir Spajic [@konrad_126](https://www.twitter.com/konrad_126)
> Git is standard tool for version control these days so we all use it daily. And we all understand it. Or do we? Let's face it - git is hard. And one of the main reason I believe it is hard is because it's UI is full of leaky abstractions. That is why, in order to get comfortable with git one must gain some understanding on how git works "under the hood". So in this talk, we're gonna do exactly that and see how git's data model works, how git handles branching and what staging are really is.
