# The Talks

## Upgrading Your Site to Drupal 9

### Oliver Davies [@opdavies](https://www.twitter.com/opdavies)
> For most Drupal Developers and users, the idea of moving a project from one major version of Drupal to another can be daunting, with modules and themes having to being changed significantly or rebuilt completely, and data being migrated from the old site to the new one.  
> This was no more so than the move from Drupal 7 to 8, but luckily this has changed for Drupal 9 and an upgrade can be done with minimal changes and not a data migration in sight!  
> In this talk, we'll look at some of the changes to Drupal's tools and processes that have made this possible, and how to move your Drupal site to Drupal 9.  

Oliver Davies is a Full Stack Web Developer and System Administrator based in the UK. He is a Senior Software Engineer and Technical Team Lead at Inviqa and a part-time freelancer specialising in Drupal and Symfony development and Linux systems administration.

## PHP 8 Is Coming

### Enrico Zimuel [@ezimuel](https://www.twitter.com/ezimuel)
> In this meetup, I'll present the upcoming features of PHP 8. I'll talk about JIT compiler, attributes, named arguments, constructor property promotion, weak maps, stringable interface, etc. Moreover, we will present a performance benchmark comparing PHP 8 and PHP 7.  

Enrico Zimuel is a developer since 1996. Open source contributor and co-author of Apigility, Expressive and Zend Framework. Core committee member of PHP FIG. TEDx and international speaker. Adjunct Professor at ITS ITC Piemonte (Italy). Principal Software Engineer at Elastic, working on the PHP and Perl libraries for Elasticsearch. Co-founder of the PHP User Group of Turin (Italy).
