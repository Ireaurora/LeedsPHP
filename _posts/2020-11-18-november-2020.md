# The Talks

## Turbocharged Development with Docker, PHPStorm and Xdebug

### James Seconde [@SecondeJ](https://www.twitter.com/SecondeJ)
> My name is James, and I have a confession to make: I’ve been a var_dump()er my whole life. I tried Xdebug once years back, but a chance brush with social media from it’s author prompted the question: is Xdebug still relevant? Is it hard to set up?    
> In a modern developer world of Docker containers and advanced IDEs, it was time to revisit how we go about writing Software at Jump24 - in this talk I’ll set up Xdebug on a test project and show you how you can turbocharge your development like we did.  

## How Are We Teaching Machines to Learn?

### Irene Sarigu [@WinnieIre](https://www.twitter.com/WinnieIre)

> AI is said to be everywhere. So why do experts seem to be focusing on ML rather than AI?  
> In this talk we’ll understand why AI isn’t really the same as ML, investigate different types of Machine Learning and take a look at some applications of this exciting field.  
> Irene is a Computer Science student at the University of York. In her experience, she is exploring different areas of technology, from Web Development at Legend to Software Engineering at NatWest and AI and Computer Vision Research at the University of York.
