# The Talks

## Testing In The Real World

### Christopher Miller [@ccmiller2018](https://www.twitter.com/ccmiller2018)
> How we use PHPUnit and TDD in order to make our lives easer. Covering how to set up tests, what the tests look like, and what to do if a test fails when you don't expect it to.

## Git Reset --hard Your Fears

### Zvonimir Spajic [@konrad_126](https://www.twitter.com/konrad_126)

> Many developers fear the reset command because of its reputation for being dangerous. While it is true that it can be dangerous and cause you to lose your changes like tears in the rain, as it is with many fears, it's mostly based on a lack of understanding. So let's give your fear of the reset command an antidote - a proper understanding of how git reset works.
