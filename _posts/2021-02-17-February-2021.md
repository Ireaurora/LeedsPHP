# The Talks

## Tips on How to Reduce the Carbon Emissions of Your Digital Activities

### Hannah Smith [@hanopcan](https://www.twitter.com/hanopcan)

> Did you know that the internet is thought to produce about the same carbon emissions as the aviation industry's fuel consumption? And if the internet was a country it would be the seventh biggest polluter in the world. Shocking isn't?  
Digital technology provides wonderful opportunities to reach and engage with others, often in ways that aren't possible using offline methods. But digital does have a significant environmental cost, which most of us aren't conscious of.  
In this session we'll discuss why & how digital technologies have an environmental impact, and we'll share ideas on how to reduce that impact.  
Hannah is a freelance WordPress developer from Bristol with a background in Computer Science. Before freelance life, amongst other things, she honed her management skills at the Environment Agency, where she managed large business change projects. She’s co-founder of Green Tech South West and is on a mission to raise awareness about the environmental impact of digital tech. She also likes dogs, plants and snow.
