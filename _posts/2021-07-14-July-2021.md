## Introduction to Coding

> Want to learn how to code but don’t know where to start? Learning to code but need more resources? In this talk you’ll discover a range of resources that you can use to get started with coding, we’ll then look at some of the fundamentals of programming and have a hand-on play with JavaScript.

Previous to joining Telmar, she explored different areas of technology, from Web Development at Legend, Software Engineering at NatWest and AI and Computer Vision Research at the University of York.
