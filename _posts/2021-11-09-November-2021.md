# The Talks

## A Practical Guide to PHP Serverless Applications

### Thibault Richard [@t__richard](https://www.twitter.com/t__richard)

> This is a step-by-step guide to hosting your PHP applications in AWS Lambda, using an approach that you can apply to almost any API or Website.
Symfony Demo uses Twig, Webpack Encore, a database, sessions, console commands, ... Sounds familar? It is the perfect fit to test this out!
And if you're using another framework like Laravel: fear not, this will work for you too!
We'll see that we can host a fully-featured application without prior knowledge about AWS or Serverless technologies and instantly benefit from infinite scaling and on-demand pricing.
Then we will expand on more advanced use cases to get a broader picture of what a serverless PHP application can look like.
You'll get a clear view of what it takes, what the benefits are, and some of the constraints and limitations.
Thibault is half backend engineer, half devops wizard at Wid'op by day and fulltime serverless enthusiast by night. He is trying his best to simplify the developer experience for people to get started with Symfony on AWS Lambda.
