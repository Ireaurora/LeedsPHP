# The Talks

## From artisan to badass: going past the basics with Laravel - Steve McDougall

### Steve McDougall [@JustSteveKing](https://twitter.com/JustSteveKing)

> Join me for this live code refactor of a basic Laravel application, as we go beyond the basic CRUD you are used to - and go down a path of discovery. We will be focusing on making our code clean, readable, reliable, contextual, and testable. From introducing Domains, to Repositories and much more between.                
Bio: Hey, my name's Steve McDougall! I work for an amazing company called Car and Classic as their Engineering Manager. When I am not working or spending time with my family, you can find me live streaming on my YouTube channel twice a week, or working on open source packages to make things that little bit easier the next time.
