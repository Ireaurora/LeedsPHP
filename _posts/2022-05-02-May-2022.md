# The Talks

## The future of continuous delivery - Paul Dragoonis

### Paul Dragoonis [@dr4goonis](https://twitter.com/dr4goonis)

> It’s the year 2021, an exciting time for the tech industry. Globally, software organizations and internet companies are delivering more and more software, at a rate and scale that we’ve never faced before. This unprecedented demand has created new challenges for us all, which have been hurting our organizations when creating continuous delivery solutions. The great thing about these new challenges is that they’ve sparked new and amazing innovations in the CI/CD industry.
* What new innovations the CI/CD, Cloud Native and Open Source communities have been developing.
* Where these innovations are taking the world of continuous delivery.
* What to expect, from the CD community, later this year, and into the future
