# The Talks

## August Social Event

> Join us for a casual social event!

We'll meeting from 18:30 at the Brewery Tap near the station.

We wanted to host a casual social event as we transition back to in-person events from September (an online version of the meet-up will always be provided).

Note: this event is not sponsored, therefore there won't be a bar tab.
