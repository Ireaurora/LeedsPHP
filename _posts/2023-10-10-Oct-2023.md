# The Talks

##  A more flexible way to store your data with MongoDB

### Kevin Smith [@kev_bite](https://sessionize.com/kevin-smith)

> If you've been anywhere near software development, the norm is to store your data in a relational form, but what if there was a different way?
We will take a look at the history of MongoDB and why it continues to be a trending database year on year. We will then go into the advantages of having a flexible document model and how we can utilize MongoDB for our application storage.
