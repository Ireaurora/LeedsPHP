# The Talks

##  Zero to CTO in 8 years. Maybe.

### ([Daniel Woolfson](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/danielwoolfson))

> The role of Engineering Manager has changed over the last decade. From my viewpoint, I will reveal what I see to be the minimum runway needed in today’s Tech market to reach a CTO job title from no coding skills, stopping at the Engineering Manager role along the way. I cover all role and project experiences required and in particular how the pivotal Engineering Manager role has changed, what it was and what the role requires now based on Agile and Architectural advances.I will be your tour guide of the Tech Manager career in modern product development methodology.

## Mindfulness, navigating through the stress

### Robert Rosebury ([@rerosebury](https://twitter.com/rerosebury))

> In software development, especially in an agile working environment engineers are often expected to figure out how to problem solve and handle emerging designs, when each team member has different information. Through practical exercise we explore some ways in which a team communicates to tell a story, solve a puzzle and reveal the resulting product.
