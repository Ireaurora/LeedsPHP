# The Talks

## Ruby on Rails as a solo founder

### Andy Callaghan

> The aim of the talk is to go through how a single developer can make a full SaaS business from scratch without needing to know countless web tech language, JS stacks etc. Rails is really good at this, and there’s countless companies run by one person (like mine!) that wouldn’t be possible without it.

## Mutation Testing with PHP

### Craig Duncan

> So you've got bugs in production, you've written unit tests, you've implemented static analysis, but you've still got bugs in production, what next? It's time to test your tests, it's turtles all the way down with mutation testing for PHP
